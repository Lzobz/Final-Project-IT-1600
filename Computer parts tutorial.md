# Computer parts and what they do 


For this tutorial I will be explaining how to put together a computer, More specifically I will be going *in depth* about what each one of these parts what they do for the computer.

Here is a list of all of the computer parts needed for this tutorial as well as some other more detailed parts.

1. Motherboard
2. Central Processing Unit (CPU)
3. Chipset
4. Basic Input and Output system (BIOS)
5. Random Access Memory (RAM)
6. PCI
7. Serial Advanced Technology Attachment (SATA)
8. Universal Serial Bus (USB)
9. Data Storage
10. Video Card
11. Sound Card
12. Network Interface Controller (NIC)
13. Power Supply
14. Cooling 
15. Case

**All of these parts play an essential part in making your computer work properly.**

Lets go through these parts in a bit more detail before we start building our computer.

### Motherboard
the motherboard serves as your computers main circuit board, as it connects the different parts of the computers and allows communication between these parts. 

### CPU 
This part carries out the instructions of a computer program like arithmetic, executing instructions, and managing data flow between different computer parts.

### Chipset
there are two chips in this set called northbridge and southbridge. the northbridge is connected to the CPU directly and is in charge of the high performance tasks of the computer. the southbridge usually is in charge of the less demanding tasks.

### BIOS 
This is a firmware used to initialize hardware when your computer starts up. It also provides runtime services for the programs in your computer. Luckily this comes pre-installed on the system board of all computers so we wont need to worry about this when it comes to building.

### RAM
This is a form of data storage that stores data only when the machine is being used. This is for when your computer needs to access something quickly like browsing between different websites or watching a video.

### PCI
this is the high-speed serial computer expansion bus standard
 
### SATA
This is the interface in a computer that connects host bus adapters to mass storage devices like a hard disk drive. 

### USB
This is the industry standard for connecting other things to your computer whether it is a mouse, keyboard, or a flash drive.

### Data storage
Usually referred to as a hard drive data storage is the recording or data in a disk. this is how your computer is able to save files and you can return to them even if the computer had been turned off. 

### Video card
This is the part of your computer which outputs images to be displayed on a screen or monitor.

### Sound card
Similarly to a video card this is the part of your computer that handles input and output od audio

### NIC
this is the part of your computer that connects it to a network. This can be done either through ethernet or Wi-Fi.

### Power Supply
This is a pretty self explanatory this is the part that provides power to your computer.

### Cooling
Cooling helps keep your computer cool when working on intensive tasks. There are many different ways to cool a computer from fans to liquid cooling.

### Case
This is the shell your computers components are placed in to.

### Now that we know all of the parts of the computer lets talk about building it.

First start with our motherboard, CPU and its cooling unit. There will be a little metal square on the motherboard, lift the leaver next to it to expose the socket and ***lightly*** place the CPU in. After this place the CPU cooler on top and lock it in and plug it into the CPU fan header in the board. Next get your RAM and align it on the motherboard(*This should look like 4 long and skinny ports*). Place them in and apply ***slight pressure*** until it is fully locked in place. After this lets look at the case. Depending on your case there are some screws that will be needed to install your motherboard. Make sure it fits and screw in the motherboard and connect the rear fan located in the case to the motherboard. next connect the power supply in the bottom of the case near the back. Then we will install the hard drive next to the power supply and plug it into the motherboard. Then align the PCI onto the openings in the back of the computer and install your video card next to it and screw it in. At this point we can connect all of the cables that power the motherboard and other components. Once all of these components are connected you should be done building your PC!
